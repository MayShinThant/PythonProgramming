I was more like in the suggester role in the team finding out the errors together, for example, why the codes do not work, and did not miss any meetings after I joined the team. We had about 10th versions of the games after refining the game again and again. 

I think Ama Pone Nyet and Eaint are the most important contributors to the team with the same effort. They are more like the main coders and very fast in finding out why the codes do not work or something like that.
